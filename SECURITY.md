# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

This project does not currently publish a formal list of supported versions.
In general, security fixes are applied only to the latest code on the default
branch. Older releases or commits are not guaranteed to receive security
updates.
## Reporting a Vulnerability

declined, etc.

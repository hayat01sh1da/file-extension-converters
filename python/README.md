## 1. Environment

- Python 3.13.0

## 2. Execution

```command
$ cd ./python
$ python main.py 
Provide the directory which contains files you would like to delete: .
Provide the dirname or filename pattern you would like to delete: *.py
Provide -e(execution) if you would truly like to delete the files. This operation is cannot be undone, so trying to run without -e once is strongly recommended:
Target dirname is /mnt/c/Users/binlh/Documents/web/file-cleaner/python

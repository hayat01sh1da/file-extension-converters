## 1. Environment

- Ruby 3.3.6

## 2. Execution

```command
$ cd ./ruby
$ ruby main.rb 
Provide the original extension of the files you would like to change(e.g., .jpg, .png, .rb, .py, .ts. .js etc.)
.rb
Provide the target extension of the files you would like to switch to by the change(e.g., .jpg, .png, .rb, .py, .ts. .js etc.)
.py
Provide -e(execution) if you would truly like to delete the files. This operation is cannot be undone, so trying to run without -e once is strongly recommended
